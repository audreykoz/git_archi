    documentation="The set of nodes drawn have uniform charateristics, to support relatiely constant run times for prompt processing codes.  Nominally these nodes can be thought of as organized into &quot;strings&quot;, where there is a node per CCD. Nominally two &quot;strings&quot; pus ready spares are provided. When not in use, these Nodes are places into the  general offline pool. ">
