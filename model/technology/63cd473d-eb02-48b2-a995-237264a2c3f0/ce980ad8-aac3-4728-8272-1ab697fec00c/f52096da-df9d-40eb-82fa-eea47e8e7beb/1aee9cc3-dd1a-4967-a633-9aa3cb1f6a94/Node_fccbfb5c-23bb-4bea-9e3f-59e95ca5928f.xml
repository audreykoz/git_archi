    documentation="The compute worker nodes are drawn from teh overall pool of nodes provides for batch processing. The set of nodes drawn have uniform charateristics, to support relatiely constant run times for prompt processing codes.  Nomincally there  nodes can be thought of as oraganized into &quot;strings&quot;, where there is a node per CCD. Nomicnally two &quot;strings&quot; pus ready spares are drawn from the pool of batch nodes when Prompt processing is needed. "/>
