    documentation="These file system(s) holds data that has been recently acquired from the spectrograph.   The file systems satisfy two needs.  A place to park data pending ingest to the data backboone, and a cache of recent and designated data for use by clients at the base, incuding the Base science platform. The file system needs to be avaiable whenever the archiving function is needed. The system needs to have sufficient performance to handle the maximum archiving  rate of the camera it suports, the ingested data are sent to the Data Backbone proper, plus a additional rate for exposing files to the  commisisoning cluster and other observatory. &#xA;&#xA;">
