    documentation="Forwarder nodes acquire the pixel data. The software design provides for forwarders to &quot;die&quot; -- as they are seleected from a pool (in this case for every image).  A Robust spectrogaph deployment might have two forwarders to provide  continuous service shodl a forwarder node fail.  For the spectrograph, forwarding nodes only perform the Archiving function.">
