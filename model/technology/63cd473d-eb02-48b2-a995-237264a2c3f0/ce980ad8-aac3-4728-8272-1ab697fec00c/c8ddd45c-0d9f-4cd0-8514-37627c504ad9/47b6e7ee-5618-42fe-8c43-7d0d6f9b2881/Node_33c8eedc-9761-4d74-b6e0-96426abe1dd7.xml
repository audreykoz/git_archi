    documentation="Forwarder nodes acquire the pixel data. The software design provides for forwarders to &quot;die&quot; -- as they are seleected from a pool (in thsi case for every image).  A Robust LSSTCam deployment will have extra forwarders to provide  continuous service should a forwarder node fail.  For LSSTCam , forwarding nodes perform both the Archiving function, and forwarding data over teh science data link to NCSA."/>
